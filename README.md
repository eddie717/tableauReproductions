### R reproductions of Tableau Public Visualizations
I find a visualizations from the [Tableau Public Galleries](https://public.tableau.com/en-gb/gallery) that I like and then download the workbook. I then open up the workbook in Tableau Public Desktop and extract the data file which I can then use to generate the visualization in R.

I have referenced the original authors for the charts.
